        <h3>What we do?</h3>
        <p>
            We provide on demand and preemptable cloud services. In addition to regular cloud services
            that are provided, we allow users to rent parts of idle instances for limited time periods 
            at a cheaper rate. 
        </p>
        <h3>What's the difference between preemptable and regular services?</h3>
        <p>
            Preemptable services can be stopped by us when server utilization is high and resumed when 
            utilization is low again. We do this by running VMs on idle instances. 
        </p>
        <h3>Usage Guidelines</h3>
        <p>
            We recommend that you run lower priority scripts such as web scraper on this type of server
            and purchace dedicated servers for high priority tasks.
